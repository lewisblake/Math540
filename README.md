# Parallel Scientific Computing

This repositiory contains sample code form a course titled Parallel Scientific Computing (Math 540) I took at Colorado School of Mines Spring 2019.

The code is implemented in C++. There are three distict projects in this repository.

## Assignment 1

This assignment executes serial code.

The files associated with this project are math540_hw1_1.cpp, math540_hw1_3a.cpp, math540_hw1_3b.cpp, functions.cpp, and functions.h.

## Assignment 2

The files associated with this project are assign2.cpp. This program is designed to utilize the C-implementation of the MPI library for parallel computations and the Eigen library for Linear Algebra.

The objective of this program is to evaluate a set of highly-oscialltory integrals. The PDF "Blake_Math540_HW2.pdf" acommpanies this program.

## Assignment 3

The files associated with this project are assign3.cpp This program is designed to utilize the C-implementation of the MPI library for parallel computations and the Eigen Library for Linear Algebra.

The objective of this program is to construct a large covariance matrix across processing cores. The PDF "lewisblake_assign3_math540.pdf" accompanies this program.
